    "Learning Intentions:\n",
    "Specify the functional requirements of a data analysis, including stating the purpose of a solution, describing use cases, and developing test cases of inputs and expected outputs.\n",
    "Specify the non-functional requirements of a data analysis.\n",
    "Success Criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "- I can clearly state the purpose of a data analysis solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- I can describe use cases that outline how the data analysis solution will be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "- I can develop test cases that include inputs and expected outputs for the data analysis solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- I can specify non-functional requirements such as performance, scalability, security, and usability for a data analysis solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- I can explain the importance of non-functional requirements in ensuring the overall quality and effectiveness of a data analysis solution.\n",

    "Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "Remember that all of your documentation is being completed using Jupyter Notebook. Until you get to the Producing and Implementing stage, all of your code should go into Markdown windows. Remember to create a repository and to push to GitHub each lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifying and Defining\n",
    "Choose your Data Scenario and Define your Purpose\n",
    "The first step is to actually decide what you want to discover. For this section it is suggested that you not only decide where to find the information, but also find out if their data is freely available as a .csv file or through an API. \n",
    "\n",
    "You should include the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data: Description of the data you are looking to analyse.\n",
    "Goal: Explanation of what you want to find out using the data.\n",
    "Source: Link to the source of your data.\n",
    "Access: Identification of whether the data is publicly available or not.\n",
    "Access Method: How you will access the data (.csv or API)\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional Requirements\n",
    "The functional requirements must outline what the program must do in order to function. \n",
    "\n",
    "The functions you need to consider for this task are:\n",
    "Data Loading: Consider aspects such as ability to load certain file types and handling errors in file loading (e.g. incorrect format, missing files).\n",
    "Data Cleaning: Does the system need to handle missing values or allow for filtering, sorting and grouping of data?\n",
    "Data Analysis: What kind of statistical analysis does the system need to allow for (e.g. mean, median, mode)?\n",
    "Data Visualisation: How will the data need to be visualised (e.g. Pandas dataframes / Matplotlib chart types)?\n",
    "Data Reporting: What output should the system include, and do we need to store the final dataset somewhere (e.g. .csv or .txt file)?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended that you use the following template to do this:\n",
    "Function Name (e.g. Data Loading)\n",
    "Description: Describe what the program needs to do.\n",
    "Input: Describe what the user will input for this to happen.\n",
    "Output: Describe what the program will output based on the user input.\n",
    "Use Cases\n",
    "Use cases essentially describe how users will interact with the system by providing an example of how it will work. The following example demonstrates how you create a use-case and the template should be used to create a use-case for each functional requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actor: User\n",
    "Goal: To load a dataset into the system.\n",
    "Preconditions: User has a dataset file ready.\n",
    "Main Flow:\n",
    "User places the dataset for reading into the correct folder.\n",
    "System validates the file format.\n",
    "System loads the dataset and displays the information in a dataframe.\n",
    "Postconditions: Dataset is loaded and ready for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-Functional Requirements\n",
    "Typically non-functional requirements would focus on performance, usability, reliability, scalability and security. However, for this task we are going to focus on usability and reliability, as the performance and scalability will not vary much due to only working with one or two datasets and security was a bit much to cram into the short time we have to complete the task. You are of course welcome to add a security layer (e.g. username + password) to your UI if you feel it's appropriate, and if you have time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, focus on the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Usability: What is required from the User Interface and a 'README' document?\n",
    "\n",
    "Reliability: What is required from the system when providing information to the user on errors and ensuring data integrity?"
