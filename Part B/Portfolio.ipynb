    "# Identifying and Defining\n",
    "## Learning Intentions:\n",
    "Success Criteria:\n",
    "- I can clearly state the purpose of a data analysis solution.\n",
    "- I can describe use cases that outline how the data analysis solution will be used.\n",
    "- I can develop test cases that include inputs and expected outputs for the data analysis solution.\n",
    "- I can specify non-functional requirements such as performance, scalability, security, and usability for a data analysis solution.\n",
    "- I can explain the importance of non-functional requirements in ensuring the overall quality and effectiveness of a data analysis solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Identifying and Defining\n",
    "- Data: I am looking to analyze the top 1000 IMDb rated movies.\n",
    "- Goal: My goal is to find what movies are highly rated and other characteristices of it (e.g. production date and genre)\n",
    "- Source: The source of the dataset is from \"Harshit Shankhdhar\", a user on Kaggle who made the .csv file.\n",
    "- Access: This file is publicly available on kaggle, you can find it at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshitshankhdhar/imdb-dataset-of-top-1000-movies-and-tv-shows.\n",
    "- Access Method: It will be accessed as a .csv file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functional Requirements\n",
    "- Data Loading: All files must be able to open and work, not being corrupted or broken of any sort. This is to ensure that all the work can be correctly viewed and graded.\n",
    "- Data Cleaning: The program needs to be able to handle any missing values while also being able to filter, sort and group specific data in the file, such as by production date, name, etc.\n",
    "- Data Analysis: It also needs to be able to analyze the data by finding the mean, median, mode and quartiles.\n",
    "- Data Visualisation: The data will be visualised in pandas dataframes, as well as being shown in different types of matplotlib graphs.\n",
    "- Data Reporting: The final input of the data sorting will be put into a new csv file in the same folder as the code. For example, if the user wants to sort the IMDb dataset with only 9+ ratings, then the file will be called \"imdb_top_1000_updated.csv\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Code\n",
    "    - Description: It must be able to efficiently analyse the dataset and sort the data to whatever the user of the program says, like movies from a specific year.\n",
    "    - Input: The program will ask what the user wants to sort the data from.\n",
    "    - Output: The person's input will be put into the code and sorted, which then is output onto a graph or a table for it to work. There will also be a .csv file to show the result as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Cases\n",
    "Actor: User\n",
    "Goal: To find the highest rated movie in the dataset.\n",
    "Preconditions: User can run the written code.\n",
    "Main Flow:\n",
    "1. User uses the UI to navigate the code.\n",
    "2. System asks what the user wants.\n",
    "3. User says the highest rated movie.\n",
    "4. System identifies and gives it.\n",
    "Postconditions: The movie has been found.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Non-Functional Requirements\n",
    "- Usability: The user interface needs to have an easy-to-use UI, where you can know what you want to sort out efficiently. The \"README\" document will need to have instructions on what to do and how to use the sorting system.\n",
    "- Reliability: If there is ever an error (e.g. not finding the right movie), there will be suggestions on how to fix it, like not entering the right spelling of the category."

    "# Research and Planning\n",
    "## Learning Intentions:\n",
    "- Collect and interpret data while adhering to privacy and cybersecurity principles.\n",
    "- Represent and store data to facilitate computation, including selecting appropriate data types, understanding data type limitations, and structuring data systematically.\n",
    "## Success Criteria:\n",
    "- I can collect data following established privacy and cybersecurity principles to ensure data protection.\n",
    "- I can interpret data while maintaining compliance with privacy regulations and cybersecurity practices.\n",
    "- I can select appropriate data types for representing and storing data to facilitate computation.\n",
    "- I can structure data systematically to support efficient computation and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Researching and Planning \n",
    "### Research of Chosen Issue\n",
    "- Purpose: I am trying to find out the top 1000 IMDb movies based on their rating. The dataset also includes some other information, such as the movie description and the total gross. Although there is a lot of info on these movies, the dataset is missing some movies from the current years, which makes it important to do further research so that it is up to date.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Missing Data: There is a total of 4 years worth of movie data (2020-2024) that are missing, which is a very important period of time. This means that lots of movies are not in the dataset, meaning people cannot find recent movies, and therefore making some people not want to use the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stakeholders: People who will benefit include people who want to find a good movie to watch.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use: Users of this data analysis will be able to search for something they want to watch, based on how to use the program, ranging from finding the right genre to how well IMDb rated the movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Privacy and Security\n",
    "- Data Privacy of Source: The data from the .csv file is completely public, the user who made it just put all the data from the IDMb website into an easy-access .csv file. There is not much need for privacy of the source, as the dataset is found on Kaggle, which is a public site where people can find datasets and more. If you register to this site, it's TOS says that your profile can be public and others can see it, so the source agreed and has the responsibilities. For the participants, they can use the dataset if they have an account, thus making them agree to the TOS. Although they have this TOS, they still need to protect the user's personal info (such as their birthdate, name, age and gender).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Application Data Privacy: The responsibilities of the program include that all of the sensetive info that is stored will not be looked or collected, the program must use a password with extra optional features (2FA, email verification) to ensure the data cannot be leaked. It should also follow all of the data privacy laws, like the right to be forgotten (all data gathered from the user is deleted).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cyber Security: Once it is available, there should be many features like user authentication, which is a process where you verify that someone who tries to access the account is the real owner (this could be done by things like 2FA, etc.). Another security feature is password hashing, where your password is encrypted into a short string of letters and numbers to prevent hackers reaching your password. This can also be used for other things like the sensitive data stored in servers, and more.\n",
